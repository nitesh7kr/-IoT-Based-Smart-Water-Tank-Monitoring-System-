 sincerely thank my mentor/supervisor, Dr. Priya Tripti, for their guidance, feedback, and  encouragement throughout this journey. Their expertise played a pivotal role in the success of  this project. I am also grateful to IINTM for providing the necessary resources and an  environment conducive to learning and innovation.
 
<h1>Project Title: IoT-Based in Smart Water Tank Monitoring System</h1> 
<h3>Water Level Data – Measures the current water level inside the tank.</h3>
<h3>• Pump Status Data – Indicates whether the water pump is ON or OFF.</h3>
<h3>• Flow Rate Data – Tracks the rate at which water is being filled or consumed.</h3>

Water management is a crucial issue in both residential and industrial sectors. Traditional water 
tank monitoring methods are inefficient, leading to water wastage, overflow, and inadequate 
supply. To address these challenges, this project presents an IoT-Based Smart Water Tank 
Monitoring System that provides real-time monitoring and automated control of water levels. 
The system consists of water level sensors, an IoT-enabled microcontroller, and a cloud-based 
dashboard or mobile application for remote access. The sensors detect the water level in the 
tank and send data to the microcontroller, which processes the information and transmits it to 
the cloud. Users can monitor water levels in real-time, receive alerts for low or overflow 
conditions, and automate pump operations to optimize water usage. 
This smart system enhances water conservation efforts, reduces human intervention, and 
ensures a continuous water supply with minimal wastage. The implementation of IoT 
technology makes it cost-effective, scalable, and suitable for various applications, including 
households, agriculture, and industries.
